The QOP operates on the perplexing foundations of qubits and quantum gates, exploiting quantum phenomena to establish a cryptosystem that defies conventional logic.

Key components of the QOP implementation include:
- Esoteric Entanglement: Qubits entwined in an inseparable quantum embrace.
- Superpositional Symbiosis: Qubits coexisting in multiple states at once.
- Translocative Transference: The arcane art of conveying quantum information across the void.

Tread carefully, for the QOP transcends the boundaries of classical understanding, lurking within the shadows of mathematical obscurity.

Examine the [Visualizations](visualizations.md) to witness the cryptic manifestations of the QOP.
